# benchmcmc â€” Benchmark analysis with MCMC

This script lets you take a series of benchmark data and see if at one
point there was a change performance.

Suppose that you run your benchmark tests on every commit that you have
(e.g. using `git-filter-branch`), and you see that your performance data
is, e.g. in requests per second or in seconds, or other measures

```
13.64
12.82
11.69
15.12
12.30
18.46
13.51
14.33
13.84
12.77
... (180 rows omitted)
10.93
11.02
12.45
11.78
12.12
13.51
10.66
10.18
10.81
12.19
```

Suppose that you wonder whether or not the performance at the start and
at the end are likely to be from two different distributions, and if so,
where the _switchpoint_ was.

Running MCMC on the data gives this plot which shows that it is likely
that the performance went from ~13.5 to 12.25 at or around the 69th
datapoint.

In the repository, there is also a script `mkbench` for generating
synthetic benchmark data.

```bash
$ python mkbench.py 100 15 3 100 14 3 [--beta] > benchmarkfile.txt
```

This generates 200 samples, 100 from `N(mu=15, sigma=3)` followed by 100
from `N(mu=14, sigma=3)`.

If you use `--beta`, you get a bit more realistic performance with a
_lower bound_ of mu.
