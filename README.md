# benchmcmc â€” Benchmark analysis with MCMC

This script lets you take a series of benchmark data and see if at one
point there was a change performance.

Suppose that you run your benchmark tests on every commit that you have
(e.g. using `git-filter-branch`), and you see that your performance data
is, e.g. in requests per second or in seconds, or other measures

```

12.82
11.69
15.12
12.30
18.46
13.51
14.33

12.77

Suppose that you wonder whether or not the performance at the start and
at the end are likely to be from two different distributions, and if so,
where the _switchpoint_ was.

Running MCMC on the data gives this plot which shows that it is likely
that the performance went from ~13.5 to 12.25 at or around the 69th
datapoint.
